I initially brought up a pull request for the submodule that is required here, but after discussing the way things worked it seemed to make more sense to just create a new project and bring that class in as the base class.

Because I'm using a submodule, you'll need to initialize it after you check out the initial codebase:

```bash
git submodule init
```
